Building personal projects and working professionally using CSS helped me get better, but I still didn't feel completely confident. It bothered me not to have confidence in working with the technology I get paid for. One important lesson I learned while using CSS is to learn CSS concepts, not specific properties. Docs are always at my disposal, helping me understand the details of a given property. The course offered by Josh really resonated with this idea."
